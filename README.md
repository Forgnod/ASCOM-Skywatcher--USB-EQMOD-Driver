# ASCOM-Skywatcher-USB-EQMOD-Driver
USB driver for EQ5/HEQ5/EQ6/EQ6-R and EQ8

For some reason the driver isnt availibe from Skywatcher anymore.
Youll find the Driver dll down below. When I find the original .exe i'll add it as well.

Version is from 2019 more Informations are coming.


How to install:

Drop the .dll file into you System32 folder.

After that you might have to ajust the Baudrate with your EQMOD Settings.
